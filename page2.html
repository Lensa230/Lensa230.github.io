         This album was one of the most influential and controversial.<br> 
         Teddy Afro's lyrical sentiments and the release of this album coincided with the elevated political tension in Ethiopia surrounding the 2005 Ethiopian general election.<br> 
         The government banned four of his songs including "Yasteseryal" from playing on Ethiopian media outlets.<br> 
         On 6 December 2006, Teddy Afro was convicted of alleged hit-and-run incident during the 2005 Ethiopian general election.<br>
         Nonetheless, the album sold more than a million copies within a few months after its release.<br>
