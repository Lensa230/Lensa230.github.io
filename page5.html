        <h2>Early life and career</h2>
        Rophnan was born and raised in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. He is the ninth child out of 10 children in his family.<br> 
        His father named him Rophnan after having a revelation during deep prayer, the name Rophnan is not in Amharic nor does it have roots in any other language.<br> 
        When he was 10 years old, Rophnan started recording tapes in his classroom, singing and improvising drums to entertain his friends.<br> 
        His music style uniquely merges traditional Ethiopian instruments with contemporary electronic music.<br>
        <h3>2006–2014: Early years</h3>
        At 16 years old, Rophnan released his first mixtape which introduced him to Ethiopian club scene.<br> 
        The mixtape became an instant success, and in a market lacking local producers, DJs were playing it all across the country.<br> 
        The Mahmoud Ahmed's remix of the legendary song "Bemin Sebeb Litash" gained the most attention.<br> 
        The remix showcased Rophnan's ability to translate traditional melodies and rhymes into powerful electronic anthems.<br>
        Rophnan continued to DJ in clubs and venues in Addis Ababa while creating and developing his own sound, a fusion of Ethiopian cultural elements, unique vocals and cutting edge music.<br>
        <h3>2014–2018: Career beginnings</h3>
        In the following years, Rophnan slowly established himself as the country's biggest DJ while introducing the country to electronic music.<br> 
        He had residencies in all the top clubs in Addis Ababa, often playing 3 shows a night.<br> 
        Rophnan kept his own music unreleased and made sure that the only place one could hear his tracks would be when he played them himself.<br> 
        One of Rophnan signature tracks, "Get To Work", a Gurage-based beat, was released this way and was played exclusively as part of Rophnan's own DJ sets,<br> 
        which made the song famous within Addis Ababa youth without having to release it.<br> 
        Rophnan played a pivotal role in the rise of electronic music and DJ culture in Ethiopia. He continued to headline more and more events packing the biggest venues.<br>
        <h3>2018–2019: Netsebraq</h3>
        n May 2018, Rophnan released his debut album, named Netsebraq, meaning "reflection".<br> 
        This was the first electronic music LP to ever be released in Ethiopia. The album was released independently by RAEY Records.<br> 
        A shorter version of the album, named Netsebraq E.P. was released by the Ghanaian label Akwaaba Music.<br>
        Netsebraq was deeply rooted in raw traditional Ethiopian music but also mixing futuristic aesthetics into the powerful songs which reflected Rophnan's generation and artistic vision.<br> 
        Introducing a new musical message, the album took a little while to be absorbed by the Ethiopian market, but in just a few months, the album's reach expanded from clubs, to street corners, to radio stations and finally became the most played album of the year.<br> 
        Respectively, Rophnan became one of the most celebrated artists in the country. The release of the album coincided with a governmental change which brought a new spirit and energy to the youth of Ethiopia, and Netsebraq became the soundtrack of those winds of change.<br>
        Soon after the album release Rophnan has performed live in the popular Ehud Be EBS TV show where he delivered a 10-minute set of live music, becoming the first artist ever to not lip-sync on the show. The video went viral and was viewed by millions.<br>
        The album won Rophnan three 2018's Leza Awards including Album of The Year, becoming a ground breaking release for an emerging genre.<br>
        <h3>Aspiration</h3>
        In the original inlay of the album, a single line was highlighted – "I Believe In My Generation".<br>
        This line has caught the attention of many because of its meaningful message. A generation of innovation, creativity, technology faith and ideas, has accepted Rophnan as one of its key ambassadors.<br> 
        Since then Rophnan has been doing countless MindSet programs at universities, schools and public events, inspiring the youth, sharing ideas and thoughts thorough discussions with his generation.<br>
